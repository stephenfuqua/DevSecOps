# Ed-Fi Tech Metrics

Jupyter notebooks and related code for calculating Ed-Fi tech team metrics.

## Use Instructions

Requires Python >= 3.10 and Poetry.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root project directory:

   ```none
   JIRA_TOKEN=<INSERT PERSONAL TOKEN FROM JIRA>
   JIRA_BASE_URL=https://tracker.ed-fi.org
   ```

2. Install package dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks either:
   1. Directly in VS Code.
   2. Or from Jupyter server: `poetry run juypter lab` (newer UI) or `poetry run
      jupyter notebook` (original UI).
4. Run all cells

Some of these will generate CSV files in the `data` directory. These files can
be used to compare results over time. Go ahead and store them in a commit when
they are accurate and complete!
